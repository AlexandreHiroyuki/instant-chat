Create instant chat rooms as fast as you cook instant noodles. Remember that their duration is just as ephemeral.

Each chat room have a unique code that you can share with your friends. Once they join, you can start chatting.
The chat room will be deleted after a few minutes once everyone leaves or if the majority of people vote on a poll to close it.
